  ## Description 
* This application allows you to generate contact cards for your team. Currently set up for a team structure of having a manager with engineers and interns. But, it could be adapted to any team's specifications. 
* The motivation behind this project was to generate a webpage for a manager that displays their team's basic info, so that they have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. 
* Every manager needs to be organized and have quick access to their team's information - this application solves that problem!
* This project made use of JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Jest, Inquirer, Classes, HTML and used BULMA for styling.
